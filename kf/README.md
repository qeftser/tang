# kf

Kalman filter section. Contains work produced from the examples and code given in the book
Fundamentals of Kalman Filtering: A Practical Approach Third Edition by Paul Zarchan and 
Howard Musoff. It is a pretty nice book :)

## numerical_basics.h

Contains code implimenting the needed functionality discussed in chapter one of the book.
This contains a simple matrix library with the nessesary routines, as well as several
random number generators to aid in the generation of gaussian and white noise. The
matrix library is implimented kind of interestingly, but works well if you know
how to use it... :O
